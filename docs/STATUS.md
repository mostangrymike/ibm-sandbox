# CMS Git project status

Updated: 2026-09-26

## Goal

Build a native Git client for CMS/z/VM 6.3 Evaluation Edition with Git logical
object/protocol compatibility and CMS-native physical storage. The practical
GitHub transport may use the EC2 host's TLS layer; Git protocol, HTTP framing,
PACK processing, objects, and refs remain owned by CMS.

## Milestone status

- M0 native CMS toolchain / command interface: DONE
- M1 SHA-1: DONE

- M8 complete PACK ordinary/OFS/REF through M8C: DONE
- M9 bounded/scalable PACK through M9P: DONE
- M10 bounded upload-pack transport / real Git fixture: DONE
- M11 native CMS TCP + bounded binary-safe HTTP: DONE
- M12 practical HTTPS transport: EC2 TLS bridge and live GitHub smart-HTTP
  discovery/upload-pack transport PROVEN. Native z/VM System SSL remains experimental.
- M13 native C live-PACK walker: 1,808-object inflation and native PACK
  SHA-1 verification and OFS_DELTA application PASSED; REF_DELTA,
  reconstructed OIDs and persistence remain.

All completed milestones above are target-proven.

## M9/M10 transport core

M9P is the consolidated bounded PACK walker. GIT9CTX uses disk-backed
`G9CDATA DATA A`, `G9CIDX DATA A`, and `G9CMETA DATA A`; the old
per-position filename scheme is gone. Ordinary objects, OFS_DELTA, REF_DELTA,
non-immediate bases, chained deltas, streaming DEFLATE/zlib, bounded object
storage, and the relevant stress gates are target-proven.

GIT10BF is a bounded pkt-line/side-band state machine. Channel 1 streams into
GITPBUF, channel 2 is discarded incrementally, and channel 3 fails in a
controlled way. M10E passed a maximum `ffff` pkt-line with a 65530-byte
channel-2 payload delivered in 31-byte fragments.

The real Git 2.47.3 M10D upload-pack fixture remains the interoperability gate:

- PACK SHA1 `00C20177E759DC5FFD06EA42D0A1D1E1A9F53E7B`
- COMMIT `59D72104FBF18B76536A3A99776C7F7930C27CD8`
- TREE `747ABC3C651FC0DD12A37E5B5C47E0D02CD0DC4E`
- BLOB `F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F`
- PACK v2, 3 objects, data end 180

## M11 native networking / HTTP

M11A proved native CMS REXX/SOCKETS TCP. M11B proved SO_ASCII OFF and bounded
binary-safe raw send/receive. M11C proved bounded HTTP header framing across a
fragmented CRLFCRLF boundary while preserving binary body bytes. M11D routed
the HTTP body directly through GIT10UP/GIT10BF/GITPBUF and reproduced the real
M10D PACK and object IDs exactly.

Current routed network:

- EC2 ens5: `172.31.14.90/20`
- EC2 tap0: `192.168.200.1/24`
- z/VM OSA1: `192.168.200.2/24`
- gateway: `192.168.200.1`
- DNS: `8.8.8.8`

Native z/VM TN3270 over this path is also proven.

## M12 native System SSL findings

The documented z/VM 6.3 Dynamic SSL client architecture was implemented far
enough to prove VMCF OPENtcp and TLSSCLIENTtcp processing. Target behavior
established these important callcodes: OPENtcp X'6E', open notification X'0B',
TLSSCLIENTtcp X'83', READYforHANDSHAKE X'25',
SECUREhandshakeCOMPLETE X'24', SENDtcp X'76', RECEIVEtcp X'71',
DATAdelivered X'0C', and VMCF RECEIVE function X'0005'.

A clean SSL server trace established the actual blocker:

    DTCSSL022E Handshake failed rc: 8 reason: Certificate validation error

It also reported:

    DTCSSL505W Local client requested use of CERTNOCHECK; Request ignored

Therefore `ValidatePeerCert=No_Check` does not bypass GitHub server
certificate validation.

The target is z/VM 6.3 service level 1302 (2013-era). Current GitHub presents a
Sectigo ECC chain: github.com -> Sectigo Public Server Authentication CA DV E36
-> Sectigo Public Server Authentication Root E46. Importing the E46 root with
GSKKYMAN failed with status `0x03353083`, "ICSF services are not available";
`CP QUERY VIRTUAL CRYPTO` reported no AP Crypto Domains. Further native crypto
archaeology is not on the critical path.

## Practical HTTPS transport — PROVEN

EC2 Debian trixie has stunnel 5.74 with modern OpenSSL. A dedicated client-mode
listener is bound only to `192.168.200.1:8443` and connects to
`github.com:443` with CA-chain validation, hostname validation, SNI, and
TLS >= 1.2.

The EC2-local plaintext HTTP test through the listener returned GitHub
`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.

CMS then ran M11BRAW against `192.168.200.1 8443`:

- REXX/SOCKETS initialized successfully.
- SO_ASCII was OFF.
- TCP connect succeeded.
- all 56 exact request bytes were sent.
- 176 bytes were received with bounded 256-byte RECV calls.
- prefix was `HTTP/1.1 301 Mov...`.
- final result: `M11B BINARY-SAFE BOUNDED SOCKET TEST PASSED`.

The 301 is expected from that diagnostic because its immutable proof request
uses `Host: example.com`. The important result is that valid decrypted HTTP
returned to CMS through the verified TLS bridge.

A separate `M12PRXY EXEC` was added for the correct `Host: github.com`
probe rather than modifying the target-proven M11B core.

## Live GitHub smart-HTTP proof — 2026-09-24

CMS successfully performed real GitHub smart-HTTP discovery through the TLS
bridge. GitHub's HTTP/1.1 response used chunked transfer encoding, so
`GIT12CHK EXEC` was added as a bounded chunk decoder. Its FILE-mode replay
decoded the live advertisement correctly.

A live upload-pack POST was then accepted by GitHub. Two request-framing bugs
were found and corrected from target evidence: the want pkt-line length is
`004a`, and the complete HTTP entity length is 87 bytes (74-byte want pkt-line
+ 4-byte flush + 9-byte done pkt-line). With those fixes GitHub returned
348,959 HTTP bytes.

The captured response passed the complete transport integrity path:

- bounded HTTP chunk decoding completed;
- upload-pack and side-band framing reached PACK state cleanly;
- `GITPBUF` finalized a 340,027-byte PACK;
- `GITPSHA VERIFY` accepted PACK SHA1
  `8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`;
- PACK v2 header reports 1,808 objects;
- `GITP9PWK` successfully reconstructed more than 200 live GitHub objects,
  including ordinary COMMIT/TREE/BLOB objects and substantial chained
  OFS_DELTA traffic, with object OIDs computed successfully.

A complete 1,808-object REXX/CMS walk was deliberately stopped because it is
too slow for a practical acceptance gate. The transport is not the bottleneck:
the complete PACK checksum already proves byte-for-byte integrity. The next
engineering problem is PACK/object materialization performance, especially
heavy EXECIO disk traffic and linear context lookup in `GIT9CTX`.

## M13 native C PACK walk — 2026-09-26

GCCCMS builds C modules using GCCE NOASM, IBM ASSEMBLE, PDPCLIB and GENMOD.
A small GITCAPI assembler adapter converts GCCCMS's argument-list convention
to GITINFA's direct six-fullword parameter-block convention. Its known-good
zlib fixture returned RC 0, output 3, consumed 11.

The native GITCWALK C + GITCAPI + GITINFA program walked the captured
340,027-byte, 1,808-object PACK in 2.14 seconds elapsed (2.10 CPU). All
1,808 object headers and zlib streams passed; final data offset 340,007
leaves the expected 20-byte trailing checksum. The live capture's SHA-1
was separately validated in M12; native GITCWALK SHA-1 verification was
subsequently proven in the checkpoint below.

This is a successful *inflation* gate, not yet a full Git object import.
The walker checks inflated delta-instruction sizes but does not apply deltas,
resolve bases, compute object OIDs or persist the resulting objects.

## Next action

After the native PACK checksum gate, implement OFS_DELTA base resolution
and delta application, followed by REF_DELTA and object SHA-1/OID checks. Preserve the existing target-proven REXX implementation
as a correctness reference and the captured PACK as the benchmark. Do not
rerun the network POST for local performance testing.

## 2026-09-26 first-object ABI and live inflate regression

The combined `GITCLNK GITCINF` build completed with three clean Assembler XF assemblies. `GITCAPI` resolves GCCCMS's argument-list ABI versus `GITNAPI`'s direct parameter-block ABI. The known-good `abc` fixture returned `RC 0 OUTPUT 3 USED 11 DATA 61 62 63`. The live PACK first object at byte offset 14 returned `RC 0 OUTPUT 270 USED 182`, establishing the second-object offset at 196; CMS printed `PASS FIRST LIVE OBJECT INFLATE`. These results corroborate the newer 1,808-object `GITCWALK` inflate-only milestone above. Native PACK trailer verification was subsequently proven; OFS/REF delta reconstruction, final object OIDs and persistence remain distinct unfinished acceptance gates.

## Native PACK checksum target proof — 2026-09-26

GITCWALK.C now computes native SHA-1 over the PACK bytes excluding the final
20-byte trailer and rejects a mismatched trailer before inflation. GCCCMS
GITCLNK GITCWALK compiled successfully with three clean Assembler XF passes.
The captured 340,027-byte PACK passed native checksum verification with SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`. GITCWALK ALL then inflated
all 1,808 objects successfully and ended at offset 340,007, exactly 20 bytes
before the trailer. CMS reported `Ready; T=3.33/3.38` (CPU/elapsed seconds).
This is the checksum-plus-inflation gate; it does not imply delta application,
base resolution, object OID calculation or persistence. The earlier 2.14-second
inflation-only measurement remains a separate proven benchmark. The corrupt-trailer negative test subsequently passed on CMS.

## Next action

Add an isolated negative checksum test without modifying the captured
GITPBUF PACK A. Then implement native OFS_DELTA base resolution and delta
application, followed by REF_DELTA, object OIDs and persistence. Preserve the
REXX walker as the correctness reference and avoid another network POST.

## Corrupt-trailer regression — CMS proven

GITCWALK BADSHA now loads the existing captured PACK into memory, flips the
last trailer byte **only in the in-memory copy**, and expects the native
checksum comparison to reject it. The CMS `GITPBUF PACK A` remains unchanged.
The negative gate returns RC 0 only when the corruption is rejected and RC 8
if the corrupted trailer is incorrectly accepted. After testing BADSHA, rerun
GITCWALK ALL as the positive regression. CMS ran GITCWALK BADSHA and printed
`PASS BADSHA: CORRUPT TRAILER REJECTED`, RC 0, CPU/elapsed 1.81/1.83 seconds.
A subsequent GITCWALK ALL verified SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`, inflated all 1,808
objects, and ended at offset 340,007, CPU/elapsed 3.30/3.34 seconds.
Both positive and negative checksum regressions are target-proven.

## Native OFS base-position gate — CMS proven

GITCWALK.C now records each object header's starting PACK byte offset in an
1,808-entry native table. For each OFS_DELTA, it decodes Git's offset distance
relative to that object's header, checks nonzero/bounded distance, and requires
the resulting base position to equal an earlier object's header offset. On a
successful walk it prints `OFS BASE POSITIONS RESOLVED N`. CMS `GITCWALK ALL` passed: SHA-1 matched, all 1,808 streams inflated,
all 1,117 OFS_DELTA base positions resolved, final offset 340,007,
and CPU/elapsed 3.44/3.49 seconds. It does **not** reconstruct delta output,
calculate object OIDs, or persist objects. Use the existing captured PACK;
rerun BADSHA as a regression after the new ALL gate if needed.

## Native OFS_DELTA application gate — prepared, not target-proven

Commit `9a0453d` adds isolated `GITCWALK OFSAPPLY` mode. The existing
`GITCWALK ALL` and `BADSHA` modes retain their previous behavior. OFSAPPLY
uses a bounded Git delta varint/copy/insert parser, retains prior reconstructed
objects by PACK index, inherits the base object's type, and applies OFS_DELTA
instructions to the resolved base. It checks base and result lengths and
copy/insert bounds with a 65,536-byte per-object cap. It prints
`OFS DELTAS APPLIED N` on success. REF_DELTA reconstruction and object OIDs
remain unimplemented in native C; OFSAPPLY stops explicitly if it encounters
a REF_DELTA. This code awaits CMS compile and target execution; do not mark
it proven before the user returns output. Test with existing captured PACK,
without repeating the network POST. First rerun ALL to ensure no regression,
then OFSAPPLY. Mac: git pull, cms-upload.sh absolute GITCWALK.C; CMS:
FILEDEF PACKIN DISK GITPBUF PACK A, GITCLNK GITCWALK, GITCWALK ALL,
GITCWALK OFSAPPLY.

## 2026-09-26 native OFS_DELTA application — TARGET PROVEN

CMS `GITCWALK ALL` verified SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`, inflated all 1,808
objects, resolved all 1,117 OFS_DELTA base positions, and ended at PACK
offset 340,007 (CPU/elapsed 3.49/3.55 seconds). The separate
`GITCWALK OFSAPPLY` mode then passed the same integrity and inflation
gates and reported `OFS DELTAS APPLIED 1117`, with final offset 340,007
(CPU/elapsed 5.19/5.27 seconds). The native OFS_DELTA application gate is
now target-proven. Native REF_DELTA support, independent reconstructed-object
OID verification, and object persistence are not yet implemented. Continue
using the unchanged captured PACK and preserve existing ALL/BADSHA gates.

## Native reconstructed-object OID gate — awaiting CMS test

Commit `3e77538` adds isolated `GITCWALK OID` mode. It retains and
reconstructs ordinary/OFS_DELTA objects exactly as target-proven OFSAPPLY,
then hashes Git's canonical `<type> <size>\\0` prefix and reconstructed
bytes with the native SHA-1 implementation. It prints OIDs for the first
three and last objects, and `OBJECT OIDS COMPUTED 1808` on success.
The OID mode has not yet been compiled or run on CMS, and its output
must be compared with an independent Git/REXX reference before claiming
OID correctness. `ALL`, `BADSHA`, and `OFSAPPLY` remain separate gates.
Native REF_DELTA resolution and CMS persistence remain future work.

## 2026-09-26 OID target proof and profiling next gate

CMS `GITCWALK OID` verified PACK SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`, inflated 1,808
objects, applied all 1,117 OFS_DELTA programs, computed 1,808 Git object
IDs and ended at byte offset 340,007 (CPU/elapsed 20.70/20.83 seconds).
Sample IDs: obj 1 COMMIT 270 bytes
`5A81BAF86E7DC7B72377087A8F160CAF8B889B74`; obj 2 BLOB 1841 bytes
`030E4837F28336A89B785202BC84B00E934F7C94`; obj 3 TREE 139 bytes
`450532795889EE54C540AC1AE9581E0FA98C7866`; obj 1808 TREE 5224 bytes
`BA9F4D66B41352F0D0266090D14AD52F37318FCB`. All OIDs were computed
on CMS, but independent comparison remains pending. OFSAPPLY previously took
5.19/5.27 seconds and ALL 3.49/3.55 seconds; do not attribute the difference
to SHA-1 until separately measured.

Commit `e5001c1` adds `GITCWALK PROFILE` as an isolated OID-equivalent mode
using C `clock()` around delta application and object hash calls. It prints
`PROFILE CLOCKS PER SEC`, `PROFILE DELTA TICKS ... BYTES ...` and
`PROFILE HASH TICKS ... BYTES ...`. PROFILE has not yet been compiled or
run on CMS. Preserve ALL, BADSHA, OFSAPPLY and OID modes. Next target gate:
Mac git pull and absolute-path cms-upload.sh GITCWALK.C; CMS FILEDEF PACKIN,
GITCLNK GITCWALK, then GITCWALK PROFILE. Do not repeat network POST.

## 2026-09-26 CMS PROFILE result and FASTOID gate

`GITCWALK PROFILE` passed PACK SHA-1, all 1,808 inflations, all 1,117
OFS_DELTA applications, and all 1,808 OID computations. The sample OIDs
matched the prior OID run. CPU/elapsed: 20.70/20.83 seconds. It reported
`CLOCKS PER SEC 1000`, `DELTA TICKS 0 BYTES 3406774`, and
`HASH TICKS 0 BYTES 3936764`. CMS `clock()` did not yield usable
per-call timing; the prior 5.27-second OFSAPPLY and 20.83-second OID
whole-run comparison suggests about 15.56 seconds additional OID-mode
work, not exclusively proven to be SHA-1.

Commit `950b199` (diagnostic fix `8ac152f`) adds isolated
`GITCWALK FASTOID` mode. Its streaming SHA-1 hashes the canonical Git
object header and reconstructed body without copying the entire body to
a contiguous hash buffer. FASTOID independently computes the existing
reference OID for every object and fails on any byte mismatch. It reports
`FAST OIDS MATCH REFERENCE 1808` only after all 1,808 match. This is
awaiting CMS compile/run; it deliberately performs both hash paths, so
FASTOID total runtime is not an optimization benchmark. Once parity
passes, a separate fast-only benchmark can measure speed. Keep ALL,
BADSHA, OFSAPPLY, OID, and PROFILE unchanged. Mac git pull and upload
absolute-path GITCWALK.C; CMS FILEDEF PACKIN, GITCLNK GITCWALK,
GITCWALK FASTOID. No network POST needed.

## 2026-09-26 FASTOID parity target proof; FASTONLY benchmark pending

CMS `GITCWALK FASTOID` passed native PACK SHA-1, inflated all 1,808
objects, applied all 1,117 OFS_DELTA programs, and computed 1,808 OIDs.
Its independent streaming SHA-1 output matched the original OID hash
byte-for-byte for every object: `FAST OIDS MATCH REFERENCE 1808`.
CPU/elapsed was 36.45/36.63 seconds, expected to include both hash
paths and therefore not a streaming-only benchmark.

Commit `9ffbbf3` adds isolated `GITCWALK FASTONLY` mode: same PACK
integrity, reconstruction and sample OID output, but hashes each object
only with the target-proven streaming implementation. FASTOID remains
available as the byte-for-byte parity regression. FASTONLY is not yet
compiled/tested on CMS. Next: Mac git pull and absolute-path upload
GITCWALK.C; CMS FILEDEF PACKIN, GITCLNK GITCWALK, GITCWALK FASTONLY.
Compare its CPU/elapsed to prior OID 20.70/20.83 seconds. No network
POST needed. Independent Git/REXX sample-OID comparison still pending.

## 2026-09-26 FASTONLY benchmark and next OPTSHA gate

CMS `GITCWALK FASTONLY` passed SHA-1, 1,808 inflations and OIDs,
1,117 OFS_DELTA applications, and final PACK offset 340,007. Sample
OIDs matched OID/FASTOID. CPU/elapsed 20.98/21.11 seconds versus
original OID 20.70/20.83 and OFSAPPLY 5.19/5.27. Streaming alone did
not demonstrate a speedup in this single run; do not claim it did.

Commit `154509c` adds isolated `GITCWALK OPTSHA` mode, using a second
SHA-1 compression routine with macro-expanded XOR rather than repeated
`bxor()` calls. Existing PACK checksum and original SHA-1 gates remain
unchanged; OPTSHA selects the alternate compression routine only while
computing object OIDs. This is an experimental benchmark, not yet CMS
compiled/tested or independently Git-verified. Mac: git pull and upload
absolute-path GITCWALK.C. CMS: FILEDEF PACKIN DISK GITPBUF PACK A,
GITCLNK GITCWALK, GITCWALK OPTSHA. Compare sample IDs and timings to
original OID 20.70/20.83 seconds; run FASTOID for established parity if
needed. Preserve prior target-proven modes and captured PACK.

## 2026-09-26 OPTSHA result, OPTCHECK parity, issue review

CMS `GITCWALK OPTSHA` passed PACK checksum, 1,808 inflations,
1,117 OFS_DELTA applications, and 1,808 OID computations, with the
four displayed sample OIDs unchanged and final offset 340,007.
CPU/elapsed 19.29/19.42 seconds versus original OID 20.70/20.83;
one-run elapsed improvement 1.41 seconds (~6.8%), not a repeated
benchmark or full optimized/reference OID comparison.

Commit `688244a` adds isolated `GITCWALK OPTCHECK`: computes optimized
and original SHA-1 OIDs for each reconstructed object, compares all
20 bytes per object, and fails immediately on mismatch. It prints
`OPT OIDS MATCH REFERENCE 1808` only on full success. OPTCHECK has not
yet been compiled or run on CMS. Test via Mac git pull, absolute-path
cms-upload.sh GITCWALK.C; CMS FILEDEF PACKIN, GITCLNK GITCWALK,
GITCWALK OPTCHECK. Its double-hash runtime is not a speed benchmark.

GitHub open-issue review: closed #4 as not planned because direct legacy
z/VM System SSL certificate-chain research is not on the practical
Git-client critical path (working validated stunnel bridge exists).
Closed #3 as not planned because interrupted long REXX-walker timing is
superseded for current native PACK benchmarks by normal completed CMS
runs. Kept #2 open: native PACK persistence/REF_DELTA and production
readiness remain unfinished despite substantial speed improvements.
Kept #5 open: automatic stunnel startup/reboot persistence is still
unproven. Do not claim these remaining tasks completed.

## Mandatory execution rule (2026-09-26)

Maximize useful autonomous work in every turn. Do not pause, request permission, or stop after an intermediate documentation/code step when more repository work can be completed independently. Stop only when actual CMS target validation is required; at that point provide exact Mac transfer and CMS test commands. Document completed work and target results in CHAT_STATE.md and docs/STATUS.md, follow all existing project rules, and never claim untested code is target-proven.

## 2026-09-26 Native STAGE gate prepared (CMS validation pending)

Commit `a2d1743` adds isolated `GITCWALK STAGE`. It runs the proven
PACK integrity, inflation, OFS reconstruction and optimized SHA-1
OID path, then writes all reconstructed objects to FILEDEF `OBJOUT`
as CMS text records. Each object has a header `OBJ index type length
40-hex-OID`, followed by uppercase hex body lines of up to 32 bytes
(64 characters) per record; empty bodies get a blank record. This is
an intermediate validated staging format, NOT Git loose-object storage.
All prior GITCWALK modes remain available. C source max line 72 chars.
CMS compilation, FILEDEF record behavior, and spool correctness have
NOT yet been target-validated. To test: Mac git pull; upload absolute
path `/Users/mikewommack/ibm-sandbox/src/GITCWALK.C` using existing
cms-upload.sh. CMS: `FILEDEF PACKIN DISK GITPBUF PACK A`,
`FILEDEF OBJOUT DISK GITSTAGE DATA A`, `GITCLNK GITCWALK`,
`GITCWALK STAGE`. Expected final `STAGED OBJECTS 1808`; inspect
`LISTFILE GITSTAGE DATA A` and first/last records after success.
Keep #2 open until persistence and REF_DELTA support are addressed.

## 2026-09-26 STAGE open failure and next isolated CMS gate

User's initial CMS `GITCWALK STAGE` successfully checked PACK SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`, inflated all
1,808 objects, applied all 1,117 OFS_DELTA instructions, computed
all 1,808 OIDs, and reached the expected final offset 340,007.
Writing failed: `DMSSOP036E Open error code 4 on OBJOUT`,
`STAGE WRITE FAIL`, CMS RC 8, CPU/elapsed 19.30/19.51 seconds.
`LISTFILE GITSTAGE DATA A` confirmed no file exists. No staging
persistence was demonstrated.

IBM FILEDEF documentation confirms open error 4 on new output if both
LRECL and BLKSIZE are unspecified. Initial FILEDEF lacked both.
For the next test, compile FIRST and then define the output:
`FILEDEF OBJOUT DISK GITSTAGE DATA A (RECFM V LRECL 80`.
Reissue `FILEDEF PACKIN DISK GITPBUF PACK A` after compilation.
Reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zvm/7.3.0?topic=commands-filedef

Commits `fa7052d` (buffer hex into <=64-char body records),
`0806eb0` (independent `VERIFY` and memory-only `BADSTG` gates),
and `04be7ee` (stage progress every 256 objects and error position)
are committed to main. Source is <=72 columns; CMS compile and the
new write/readback modes have not yet been target-tested. Details
and exact commands are in `docs/NATIVE_STAGE.md` (commit `faf7b05`).
Next target test: git pull and transfer absolute-path GITCWALK.C,
`GITCLNK GITCWALK`, FILEDEFs above, `GITCWALK STAGE`,
`LISTFILE GITSTAGE DATA A`, `GITCWALK VERIFY`,
`GITCWALK BADSTG`. Expected: `STAGED OBJECTS 1808`,
`STAGE VERIFIED OBJECTS 1808`, and
`PASS BADSTG: ALTERED BODY REJECTED`.

GitHub issue #2 was retitled to native PACK object persistence and
REF_DELTA support, remains open. Issue #5 remains open for durable
stunnel startup. Do not pause for permission when repository work can
proceed; stop for necessary CMS validation only.

Source review caught an EBCDIC portability hazard in the new stage
code: literal numeric byte 10 is not a portable C newline on CMS.
Commit `f895939` replaces numeric delimiter constants with proper
`'\\n'`/`'\\r'` character escapes before any CMS write/readback test.

## Host-side independent regression gate (2026-09-26)

The host-only test `tests/native_stage_host.c` and its shell runner
`tests/run-native-stage-host.sh` compile `GITCWALK.C` as C89, stage
1,808 synthetic objects, read back and rehash every record, pass a
non-destructive in-memory corruption gate, demonstrate detection of an
actual corrupted disk record, restore the record, and pass readback
again. The runner independently checks Git's native `git hash-object`
result for `blob 3\\0abc`: `f2ba8f84ab5c1bce84a7b441cb1959cfc7093b7f`.

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/native-stage.yml` run
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36271371785
completed successfully. Its job logs show `STAGE VERIFIED OBJECTS 1808`,
`PASS BADSTG: ALTERED BODY REJECTED`, detection of disk tamper, and
`HOST STAGING AND GIT OID TEST PASSED`. These are HOST tests with
synthetic data, NOT CMS target proof or real-PACK staging proof.

Source code and stage test commands in `docs/NATIVE_STAGE.md` remain
a CMS validation gate. Do not stop for non-CMS repository tasks; only
request the real CMS compile/run when needed.

## 2026-09-26 max-autonomy follow-on: native staged OID index and GET

Mandatory work rule: maximize independent repository work each turn;
do NOT stop after intermediate implementation or docs if other repo
work remains. Stop only for actual CMS target validation. No background
work is promised. This rule and all prior project rules remain active.

After the failed CMS STAGE attempt (`DMSSOP036E` output open error 4),
the staging code got explicit CMS-output FILEDEF guidance and HOST
verification; target STAGE/VERIFY/BADSTG still require a CMS run.
Additional independent work completed before stopping:

- `src/GITCIDX.C` is a separate bounded C89 program; BUILD reads
  exactly 1,808 staged descriptors and checks every bounded hex body,
  sorts binary 20-byte OIDs, normalizes matching duplicates, rejects
  conflicting duplicates and writes a versioned CMS text OID index
  with a mandatory END trailer.
- CHECK rejects malformed, unsorted, duplicated, truncated and extra
  index records. FIND validates the index and binary-searches an OID.
- GET validates the index, walks STGIN to the indexed object, strictly
  parses records, recomputes canonical Git SHA-1 over the selected
  staged body with its own C89 implementation and rejects a mismatch.
  Success reports metadata and a bounded 16-byte hex prefix. This is
  a prototype retrieval path, NOT a committed loose-object database.
- `tests/native_index_host.c` exercises 1,808 synthetic objects,
  duplicate normalization (8 unique synthetic OIDs), positive/negative
  indexed lookup, independently hashed GET, valid-hex body corruption,
  malformed stage hex, malformed index entry, incomplete trailer and
  restoration. The host runner compares C SHA-1 to Git's own
  `git hash-object` for commit/tree/blob/tag on both empty and
  three-byte bodies.
- CI passed https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36271873734
  for expanded GET/tamper tests and
  https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36271801328
  for all-four-type Git OID cross-check.
- The procedures and source format are documented in
  `docs/NATIVE_STAGE.md` and `docs/NATIVE_INDEX.md`; README updated;
  issue #2 updated but must remain open. Issue #5 also remains open.

Next ONLY CMS-dependent gate: Mac git pull and existing cms-upload.sh
absolute-path upload BOTH `src/GITCWALK.C` and `src/GITCIDX.C`.
On CMS compile `GITCLNK GITCWALK` and `GITCLNK GITCIDX`
BEFORE output FILEDEFs; define PACKIN, OBJOUT with
`FILEDEF OBJOUT DISK GITSTAGE DATA A (RECFM V LRECL 80`,
STGIN, IDXOUT with
`FILEDEF IDXOUT DISK GITINDEX DATA A (RECFM V LRECL 80`,
and IDXIN. Run GITCWALK STAGE, VERIFY, BADSTG; GITCIDX BUILD, CHECK,
FIND and GET against known first/last captured OIDs. Full commands
are in docs/NATIVE_INDEX.md. No new live GitHub POST needed.
Do NOT claim CMS staging, CMS indexing, or real-PACK GET proven until
user sends successful actual target output.

## 2026-09-26 CMS target proof: staged readback and full unique index

Target logs from user, no repeated live POST:
`GITCLNK GITCWALK` built with no assembler flags (4.78/5.01 s).
`GITCLNK GITCIDX` built with no assembler flags (2.47/2.59 s).
Issuing `FILEDEF OBJOUT DISK GITSTAGE DATA A (RECFM V LRECL 80`
after compilation fixed the original OBJOUT open error 4.
`GITCWALK STAGE` verified PACK SHA-1
`8C92E274ECA84B797F8925A6082915DD6CCDE196`;
1,808 PACK objects, 1,117 OFS_DELTA applied and all 1,808 optimized
OIDs computed; final offset 340,007. `STAGE WRITTEN` checkpoints
256,512,768,1024,1280,1536,1792; `STAGED OBJECTS 1808`.
CPU/elapsed 24.89/25.32 s. `GITCWALK VERIFY`: independent readback
and rehash of all 1,808 staged bodies passed, including first
5A81BAF86E7DC7B72377087A8F160CAF8B889B74 and last
BA9F4D66B41352F0D0266090D14AD52F37318FCB; 22.64/22.84 s.
`GITCWALK BADSTG`: `PASS BADSTG: ALTERED BODY REJECTED`,
0.01/0.01 s, stages unaffected. `GITCIDX CHECK` printed
`INDEX VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808`, 0.13/0.14 s. The posted
log did not include `GITCIDX BUILD` itself; CHECK establishes
that a complete and valid 1,808-unique-object index exists, without
claiming BUILD timing. `GITCIDX GET` successfully rehashed first
OID, returning OBJ 1 TYPE 1 SIZE 270 (0.13/0.14 s), and last OID,
returning OBJ 1808 TYPE 2 SIZE 5224 (7.49/7.59 s). Console
line for PREFIX was truncated on capture; full prefix not asserted.
GET cost grows with the target's staging-file ordinal because
GITCIDX scans staged preceding records. Next optimization:
experiment with separate offset/seek index mode without replacing
the target-proven original; target CMS `ftell/fseek` on variable
records MUST be validated before trusting random access.

This is real CMS target proof for reconstructed staging, independent
readback, non-destructive negative gate, valid unique index and
GET from both ends of the real captured PACK. It is NOT committed
generation/restart proof, full per-OID independent cross-Git hash
verification of actual captured data, or native REF_DELTA support.
Keep issue #2 open and continue autonomous repository work until
actual CMS validation of next isolated experiment.

## 2026-09-26 follow-on: host-verified AUDIT and experimental SGET

Actual CMS STAGE, VERIFY, BADSTG, INDEX CHECK and first/last GET
passed on the captured real PACK as recorded immediately above.
The record is **1,808 unique native-indexed OIDs**, all reconstructed
bodies independently rehashed on CMS. Last sequential GET elapsed
7.59 s versus first GET 0.14 s; GET walks preceding staged records.

Autonomous follow-on committed:
- `GITCIDX AUDIT`: read proven V1 index, scan all 1,808 staged
  bodies, independently recompute each Git OID, reconcile header
  type/size/index earliest ordinal and check all unique index OIDs
  are represented; fails on malformed/stale/truncated data.
- Separate experimental `GITCIDX SBUILD` / `SCHECK` / `SGET`.
  SBUILD collects ftell tokens for each staged header and stores a
  binary-OID-sorted index with an SIDX1/SEND version and completeness
  trailer. SCHECK validates entire seek index. SGET uses fseek on a
  freshly reopened STGIN and hashes the actual selected body before
  returning. Old V1 BUILD/CHECK/GET remain unchanged. New file is
  `GITSEEK INDEX A` through FIDXOUT/FIDXIN, never overwrite V1
  `GITINDEX DATA A`. CMS ftell/fseek across file reopen is NOT
  target-proven; fail closed if unavailable.
- Host tests for 1,808 synthetic objects, AUDIT, negative stage
  corruption, synthetic duplicate normalization, direct SGET,
  stale-body hash rejection, and incomplete seek trailer passed:
  https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36272574127
  . All four canonical type hashes against Git on empty and
  nonempty fixtures were already CI-proven.

Current only target-dependent checkpoint, without rerunning STAGE:
Mac `git pull` then upload absolute-path `src/GITCIDX.C` with
existing `cms-upload.sh`. CMS `GITCLNK GITCIDX` BEFORE FILEDEFs;
`FILEDEF STGIN DISK GITSTAGE DATA A`;
`FILEDEF IDXIN DISK GITINDEX DATA A`;
`FILEDEF FIDXOUT DISK GITSEEK INDEX A (RECFM V LRECL 80`;
`FILEDEF FIDXIN DISK GITSEEK INDEX A`.
Run `GITCIDX AUDIT`, `GITCIDX SBUILD`,
`GITCIDX SCHECK`, then `GITCIDX SGET` for first OID
5A81BAF86E7DC7B72377087A8F160CAF8B889B74 and last OID
BA9F4D66B41352F0D0266090D14AD52F37318FCB. Compare latter
elapsed with old sequential GET 7.59 s. Commands fully documented
in `docs/NATIVE_INDEX.md`. Next native REF_DELTA and recoverable
generation storage not yet implemented; issue #2 remains open.

Mandatory user rule remains: maximize independent work every turn,
pause only for actual CMS validation, follow all project rules.

## 2026-09-26 CMS compiler EXEC migration: neutral name and GCC F

User requested no unnecessary pauses and the existing C compiler
wrapper renamed to a non-Git name on the same F disk as GCCCMS.
Canonical repository build wrapper is now `src/CMSCLNK.EXEC`
(commit `6dbc8a4`); original `src/GITCLNK.EXEC` removed from
the repository in commit `83c1e419`, while existing CMS A-disk
`GITCLNK EXEC A` is preserved as a target-proven rollback until
the replacement is actually installed and tested. Do NOT erase the
existing old A-disk wrapper before verifying the new F-based build.

`CMSCLNK name [NAPI|PLAIN]`: defaults to NAPI and preserves
the proven GCCE C A NOASM STD380, generated source ASSEMBLE,
GITCAPI/GITINFA assembly, PDPCLIB LOAD, and GENMOD sequence.
New optional PLAIN compiles/assembles/loads ordinary C modules
without Git-specific native inflater adapters. This is designed
as a reusable GCCCMS build tool, unlike the historical name.
It uses source files on A even when CMSCLNK resides on F.
Source fixed-card max 63 columns, filename under eight chars.
CI static validation of script structure, preserved native
link sequence and documented F installation passed
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36273033118
. The CI cannot validate the REXX script on actual CMS.

F writability has not been observed. IBM-documented `QUERY DISK F`
reports R/W or R/O, and `COPYFILE CMSCLNK EXEC A CMSCLNK EXEC F`
moves a copy only if F is R/W. Canonical Mac upload uses the one
existing c3270: git pull, then cms-upload.sh absolute paths for
CMSCLNK.EXEC and current GITCIDX.C. If F is writable, use COPYFILE
and STATE CMSCLNK EXEC F, then erase only CMSCLNK EXEC A after
successful copy (so program search resolves F). If F is R/O, leave
the new A-disk copy usable temporarily: do not attempt unauthorized
remount or modify GCC disk; authorized write access is required
for requested final F placement.

Actual next CMS validation combines F placement, a new PLAIN build
of GITCIDX, and host-proven AUDIT and experimental SBUILD/SCHECK/
SGET using previously target-proven GITSTAGE DATA A and existing
GITINDEX DATA A. The experimental seek index is a DIFFERENT
GITSEEK INDEX A file; never overwrite the proven V1 index.
Compare last-object SGET elapsed to V1 GET 7.59 s.
Detailed exact Mac and CMS commands are in docs/NATIVE_INDEX.md
and docs/BUILD.md. No new network PACK POST or restaging needed.
Maintain all other project rules and maximize independent work;
pause only for genuine CMS target validation.

## 2026-09-26 GCC F disk confirmed writable

User supplied live `Q DISK`: GCCLIB at VDEV 29D is F R/W,
20 cylinders, 4K blocks, 38 files, 1,545 used and 2,055 free.
The canonical non-Git compiler wrapper src/CMSCLNK.EXEC can be
installed beside GCC via COPYFILE from temporary A to F, followed
by STATE CMSCLNK EXEC F. Erase the A copy only on verified copy.
Retain old target-proven GITCLNK EXEC A as a fallback until actual
CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN build succeeds; the existing GITINDEX DATA A
is protected during separate GITSEEK INDEX A experiment.
No remount or access change required; no installation or build
result has yet been supplied.

## 2026-09-26 CMS target proof: AUDIT and direct seek

User CMS output: `GITCIDX AUDIT` printed `AUDIT VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808`, CPU/elapsed 20.96/21.09 seconds. `GITCIDX SBUILD` wrote 1,808 unique entries in 7.13/7.21 seconds. `GITCIDX SCHECK` verified all 1,808 unique entries in 0.14/0.15 seconds. `GITCIDX SGET` on OID `5A81BAF86E7DC7B72377087A8F160CAF8B889B74` returned object #1, commit (type 1), 270 bytes, in 0.15/0.15 seconds. `SGET` on OID `BA9F4D66B41352F0D0266090D14AD52F37318FCB` returned object #1808, tree (type 2), 5224 bytes, in 1.72/1.77 seconds. Previous original indexed sequential GET for last object elapsed 7.59 seconds; direct SGET last object was 4.29x faster, elapsed reduction ~76.7%, single runs. The source output prefix is truncated by terminal capture and not independently asserted. The successful separate runs establish CMS `ftell` positions saved during SBUILD can be reused by `fseek` after reopening STGIN from another invocation for this unchanged staging file. NO reboot or modified-stage cookie lifetime proof. The leading `Ready; T=3.41/3.56` in user's paste has no associated preceding command. Therefore CMSCLNK F installation and PLAIN mode may have succeeded, but the visible transcript does not independently identify or prove that command. Do not mark F-based compiler placement proven until explicit `STATE CMSCLNK EXEC F` and a labeled build result are available.

Full stage + original index + new AUDIT + direct seek are target-proven for the captured PACK. Next independent development: native backward REF_DELTA resolution and bounded synthetic tests, while preserving current target-proven modes and staging/index files. User rule: maximize work per turn; only pause when actual CMS validation becomes necessary.

## 2026-09-26 target-proven direct seek; host-proven backward REF_DELTA

Latest user CMS output: `GITCIDX AUDIT` verified 1,808 stored objects and
1,808 unique index entries (20.96 CPU/21.09 elapsed seconds).
`SBUILD` wrote an independent 1,808-unique seek index
(7.13/7.21 seconds); `SCHECK` passed (0.14/0.15 seconds).
`SGET` succeeded across separate CMS invocations and file reopen:
first captured commit OID `5A81BAF86E7DC7B72377087A8F160CAF8B889B74`,
object 1/type 1/270 bytes at 0.15/0.15 seconds; last captured tree
OID `BA9F4D66B41352F0D0266090D14AD52F37318FCB`,
object 1808/type 2/5,224 bytes at 1.72/1.77 seconds.
Original V1 sequential `GET` took 7.49/7.59 seconds for that last
object. The one-run last-object direct-seek improvement is 4.29x,
about 76.7% lower elapsed time. This proves ftell/fseek cookies
persist across a new invocation on the **unchanged** STGIN file;
not across disk mutation or reboot. Console output prefixes were
truncated, so no complete prefix was asserted. Leading user
`Ready T=3.41/3.56` has no associated command; do not assume
CMSCLNK F installation/PLAIN build was proven. F disk was already
confirmed R/W in earlier `Q DISK` output.

Continued autonomous development after these target results.
`src/GITCWALK.C` now supports bounded backward same-PACK native
REF_DELTA resolution by reconstructed base OID and proper inherited
object type, including chained REF_DELTA. In OFSAPPLY path, base OIDs
are computed on demand when first needed; zero-REF captured PACK
retains its existing behavior. Unresolved, forward or external
bases fail closed rather than accessing uninitialized objects.
New `RTEST` in-memory chain/negative gate, `RPACK` bounded
variable-length synthetic PACK integration mode, and `RAPPLY`
no-prehash gate; no change to saved GITPBUF/STAGE/IDX files.
`tests/make-native-ref-pack.py` creates CMS 64-char ASCII hex
positive REFPACK plus REFBAD/REFFWD/REFSIZE/REFSHA negatives.
`tests/native_ref_pack_host.c` substitutes zlib only for CMS
inflater. Git's own `git index-pack --stdin` and `git cat-file`
independently accept/reconstruct all 3 reference fixture blobs
(abc, abcd, abcde); expected OIDs match Git hash-object.
Positive fixture ends at offset 94, 2 REF deltas; negative missing,
forward, malformed delta base size and bad trailer all rejected.
Full latest host CI passed:
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36274025088 .
Actual updated REF C code and fixture tests NOT YET CMS-validated.
Complete concise Mac/CMS test instructions in `docs/NATIVE_REF.md`.
Do not rerun network POST or overwrite 1,808-object real PACK.
Still missing native external/forward REF base resolution and
recoverable store/restart proof; leave GitHub issue #2 open.

Rule: maximize independent work each turn; pause only for genuine
CMS validation. Preserve source max 80 columns, current compiled
CMS modules, single Mac c3270 uploader, and protected stage/index.

## 2026-09-26 confirmed CMS EBCDIC canonical OID bug and fix

User target: `CMSCLNK GITCWALK` NAPI compiled cleanly (5.10 CPU /
5.33 elapsed seconds). Original `GITCWALK RTEST` printed a false-pass
non-Git SHA-1 of `0414AADE456A43A390C3A0E689DD2CDE0439DAA7`.
The valid transferred synthetic REF PACK (114 bytes, checksum
9CD9B4CCFA5D5371C608230D3157F4766248355F) decoded blob ABC
with correct zlib return and 11 consumed bytes, but computed OID
5492DC378EC7097F3437B18BE17F4C58D0923A03 rather than Git's
F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F; both RPACK/RAPPLY
failed `UNRESOLVED REF BASE OBJ 2` with RC8. Verified exactly:
CMS code's sprintf built a **CP037 EBCDIC** header
`8293968240F300` for blob3; SHA-1 of that header plus ASCII
`616263` exactly equals erroneous 5492DC... . Git requires
raw ASCII header `626C6F62203300`; SHA-1 of header plus
`616263` is F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F.
Old RTEST also used native EBCDIC character constants for its body,
explaining old 0414AA... rather than Git's correct ABCDE SHA-1
6A8165460570531A1247BD99A73B53A5A6E500D5.

Current repo FIXES BOTH programs, not just REF lookup:
- GITCWALK canonical_head and GITCIDX idx_head use explicit raw ASCII
  type name, 0x20 separator, 0x30+decimal-digit and NUL 0x00
  before appending raw object body. No native-text sprintf for Git
  object hashing. Both regular and optimized SHA-1 use fixed header.
- RTEST uses ASCII byte constants for ABC, D and E and directly
  validates the known Git ABC and ABCDE digests. GITCIDX SELF checks
  the known Git ABC digest without any staging file.
- New IDX2/SIDX2 reader/writer formats plus END2/SEND2 explicitly
  REJECT incompatible historical IDX1/SIDX1 indexes; host negative
  regressions prove rejection.
- New GITCIDX SVAUDIT independently reopens and SHA-1-checks every
  stored direct-seek cookie, with progress each 256 entries.
- Source-guard CI enforces no native sprintf Git header.
- All host code and tests pass, including independent Git-generated
  fixture and complete 1,808 synthetic stage/index and seek-audit
  tamper/legacy-version tests:
  https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36274871780 .
  Static ASCII/CMS source guard CI also passed:
  https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36274777916 .

CRITICAL: The earlier CMS 1,808-object OID parity and STAGE/VERIFY/
AUDIT/SGET results were internally consistent but all shared the
same EBCDIC canonical header bug. These runs prove raw PACK checksum,
decompression, OFS reconstruction, bounded CMS files and real fseek
behavior, NOT Git-compatible object identities. Mark all historical
GITSTAGE DATA A, GITINDEX DATA A (IDX1), GITSEEK INDEX A (SIDX1) as
LEGACY, never as production Git object store. Preserve legacy files;
do not overwrite or erase them until correct replacement validated.
The captured GITPBUF PACK A binary is still valid and needs NO
new GitHub download. Inspected older REXX GITBOID/GITOID already
construct ASCII headers as literal HEX and do not share this C flaw.
Do not fabricate corrected first/last OIDs for the real captured
PACK before the updated C source computes them on CMS.

Next actual CMS-dependent gate only: Mac git pull then upload updated
GITCWALK.C and GITCIDX.C via existing cms-upload.sh. Existing REFPACK
PACK A already transferred and checksum-validated; no retransmission.
Compile CMSCLNK GITCWALK and CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN BEFORE FILEDEFs;
run GITCWALK RTEST, GITCIDX SELF; set PACKIN REFPACK PACK A,
run GITCWALK RPACK and RAPPLY. Expect known Git ABC/ABCD/ABCDE
OIDs, 3 objects, 2 REF DELTAs, no missing base, and correct PACK
checksum. When these pass, rebuild the existing captured PACK
OFFLINE into distinct GITFIX STAGE A, GITFIX INDEX A and
GITFIX SEEK A (IDX2/SIDX2); run STAGE, VERIFY, BUILD, CHECK,
AUDIT, SBUILD, SCHECK and SVAUDIT without touching legacy files.
New complete commands in docs/CANONICAL_OIDS.md. Corrected C code,
new indexes and SVAUDIT are HOST-proven only, NOT CMS-proven yet.
CMSCLNK NAPI compilation is target-proven; F disk is confirmed R/W,
but physical installed EXEC F state and CMSCLNK PLAIN test remain
unverified until labeled target output is seen.

Observe mandatory max-work-per-turn rule: no pause except for
actual CMS target validation. Keep issue #2 open for correct OID
migration, forward/external REF and durable generation/recovery.

### Latest canonical OID host gate

Final host CI run https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36275050558 succeeded after adding an explicit GITCIDX SELF invocation to host regression. Its logs include correct `CANONICAL ABC OID F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F`, `INDEX CANONICAL ASCII ABC PASSED`, successful backward REF PACK Git checks, and full `SEEK AUDIT VERIFIED UNIQUE 8` with corruption rejection. The complete safe CMS retest plus IDX2 migration procedure and expected markers are in docs/CANONICAL_OIDS.md. Main remains GitHub canonical; corrected code is HOST-proven and requires the real CMS retest before production use.

## 2026-09-26 18:42–18:43 CDT: corrected ASCII and REF target gate PASSED

User supplied the complete real CMS output: `GITCWALK RTEST`
printed `CANONICAL ABC OID F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F`
and `REFTEST OID 6a8165460570531a1247bd99a73b53a5a6e500d5`,
then `REF BACKWARD CHAIN AND NEGATIVE TESTS PASSED` (0.01 CPU /
0.02 elapsed). `GITCIDX SELF` printed
`INDEX CANONICAL ASCII ABC PASSED` (0.01/0.01).
With `FILEDEF PACKIN DISK REFPACK PACK A`, `GITCWALK RPACK`
verified PACK SHA-1 `9CD9B4CCFA5D5371C608230D3157F4766248355F`,
114 bytes and 3 objects; OBJ 1 blob abc OID
F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F,
OBJ 2 REF_DELTA reconstructed blob abcd OID
85DF50785D62D3B05AB03D9CBF7E4A0B49449730,
OBJ 3 chained REF_DELTA reconstructed blob abcde OID
6A8165460570531A1247BD99A73B53A5A6E500D5,
`PASS 3 OBJECTS NEXT OFFSET 94`, OFS=0, REF=2,
OIDs=3, CMS 0.01/0.03. `GITCWALK RAPPLY` independently passed
all 3 objects and 2 REF deltas without normal OID output,
0.01/0.02. These are target-proven **correct Git canonical ASCII
OID hashing** for tested vectors and **backward same-PACK chained
REF_DELTA** (with normal and on-demand base OID paths).

No actual negative REFBAD/REFFWD/REFSIZE/REFSHA CMS runs were
included in this latest user transcript: the negative fixtures
remain host-tested only; do not mark them target-proven. Nor was
the corrected full captured 1,808-object PACK restaged on CMS.
Existing GITPBUF PACK A stays verified; old GITSTAGE DATA A,
GITINDEX DATA A (IDX1) and GITSEEK INDEX A (SIDX1) remain
legacy with noncanonical Git OIDs; keep all untouched.

The next CMS-only step is the **offline canonical migration**:
use existing GITCWALK and GITCIDX binaries and existing
GITPBUF PACK A; create NEW GITFIX STAGE A (RECFM V LRECL 80)
and run GITCWALK STAGE/VERIFY, then new GITFIX INDEX A
(IDX2) BUILD/CHECK/AUDIT and GITFIX SEEK A (SIDX2)
SBUILD/SCHECK/SVAUDIT. Do not recompile/transfer/re-download
unless an independent code change is needed. Use docs/CANONICAL_OIDS.md
for exact commands. Preserve old files and never infer corrected
first/last captured PACK OIDs from historical values.

User rule: MAX WORK PER TURN; do all independent GitHub code,
regression, docs, issue hygiene possible; pause only for genuine
CMS validation. Keep issue #2 open for target-proven canonical
migration, external/forward REF and generation recovery.

### Independent follow-on after CMS canonical REF success

Committed GITCIDX optional PAIR: load both canonical IDX2/SIDX2
indexes via IDXIN/FIDXIN, compare each sorted binary OID, ordinal,
type and size and then invoke SVAUDIT to reopen/re-hash every
referenced staged body from STGIN. PAIR reports
`PAIR VERIFIED UNIQUE 1808` on a valid complete canonical real-PACK
migration. It fails on stale/mismatched index descriptor or body
tampering; host synthetic regression deliberately mutates valid
SIDX2 descriptor and body, checks rejection, restores them, and
checks acceptance. Latest host CI PASSED:
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36280431393 .
New PAIR code is NOT in the older GITCIDX binary already run by the
user; it is OPTIONAL for the initial canonical migration and would
need the latest GITCIDX.C uploaded and recompiled in a later CMS
gate. Do not make its availability a prerequisite to running the
already prepared full 1,808-object offline canonical STAGE/VERIFY,
BUILD/CHECK/AUDIT, and SBUILD/SCHECK/SVAUDIT commands. Those
original CMS modules and GITPBUF PACK A are already present. Docs:
docs/CANONICAL_OIDS.md and docs/NATIVE_INDEX.md. Issue #2 remains
open until corrected full real-PACK migration and later external/
forward REF plus generation recovery are target-proven.

## 2026-09-26 18:50–18:54 CDT: full canonical GITFIX rebuild passed except slow SVAUDIT

User supplied actual corrected 1,808-object offline migration output.
`GITCWALK STAGE` read unchanged GITPBUF PACK A: SHA-1

all staged bodies and 1,808 unique index entries in
20.86/20.99 seconds. `SBUILD` wrote the new SIDX2
GITFIX SEEK A, 1,808 UNIQUE in 7.29/7.39 seconds.
`SCHECK` verified all 1,808 UNIQUE in 0.14/0.15.
`SVAUDIT` printed `SEEK AUDIT PROGRESS 256` and
user reported stalled/slow. The transcript contains NO completion
marker/return code for SVAUDIT; do NOT claim target SVAUDIT passed.
There is no evidence of stage or index corruption: everything
up to the SVAUDIT invocation passed.

Source inspection diagnosed slow audit: old SVAUDIT invoked
sidx_get 1,808 times, each reopening/closing STGIN; this is
unnecessary and especially expensive on CMS variable records.
Independent fixes made in GitHub source after user's installed build:
1. Reusable sidx_read_at(FILE*,OID) primitive: normal SGET still
opens/closes its own stream, and SVAUDIT opens STGIN only ONCE,
then fseeks and rehashes all unique objects.
2. New `GITCIDX SFAST` reads STGIN sequentially once, rehashes
all 1,808 objects, cross-checks descriptor metadata and compares
each unique entry's saved ftell cookie to the actual reopened
stream position, requiring full SIDX2 coverage. This removes
both 1,808 repeated opens and 1,808 repeated random fseeks
while checking the real seek-cookie values.
3. `GITCIDX PAIR` compares complete IDX2 vs SIDX2 descriptor
sets then invokes SFAST, avoiding the expensive old SVAUDIT path.
Original separate SGET remains intact. Host regression asserts
SFAST, SVAUDIT and PAIR use only ONE STGIN fopen each, tests
1,808 synthetic staged entries, stale/mismatched indexes,
corrupted contents and recovery. Full CI PASSED:
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36281295118 .
All new audit code is HOST-tested, NOT CMS target-validated yet.

For current user execution: If old SVAUDIT is still active,
CMS PA1 can interrupt its READ-ONLY work. The already complete
GITFIX STAGE/INDEX/SEEK files are unaffected; do not rerun
PACK STAGE or index BUILD. Next actual CMS gate is Mac git pull,
upload current absolute-path src/GITCIDX.C using the existing
single c3270 cms-upload.sh. CMS `CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN` before
reissuing FILEDEFs. Define STGIN GITFIX STAGE A, IDXIN
GITFIX INDEX A, FIDXIN GITFIX SEEK A; run
`GITCIDX SFAST` (expected FAST AUDIT VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808),
`GITCIDX PAIR` (expected PAIR VERIFIED UNIQUE 1808),
`GITCIDX SGET 00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C`
and `GITCIDX SGET EB37E3F23FF4FC137D715D71A711D3B7632D75F2`.
Observe actual CMS elapsed for SFAST/PAIR; do not predict.
Keep old GITSTAGE DATA A, GITINDEX DATA A (IDX1), GITSEEK
INDEX A (SIDX1) as legacy snapshots. Preserve correct new
GITFIX files. After SFAST/PAIR target proof, continue with
external/forward REF and safe generation/reboot recovery;
issue #2 remains open. Mandatory max-work-per-turn rule active.

## 2026-09-26 19:06–19:07 CDT FILEDEF readiness

User's latest CMS transcript: `FILEDEF STGIN CLEAR`, `IDXIN CLEAR` and `FIDXIN CLEAR` each returned `DMSFLD704I Invalid CLEAR request`, consistent with no existing definitions to clear after previous compilation. Immediately afterward, `FILEDEF STGIN DISK GITFIX STAGE A`, `FILEDEF IDXIN DISK GITFIX INDEX A` and `FILEDEF FIDXIN DISK GITFIX SEEK A` all returned normal `Ready` without error. Required current input FILEDEFs are therefore set; do not repeat CLEAR, redefine, retransfer, rebuild the PACK, stage or index. Proceed directly to read-only `GITCIDX SFAST`, `GITCIDX PAIR`, and canonical first/last SGET using 00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C and EB37E3F23FF4FC137D715D71A711D3B7632D75F2. The successful FILEDEF definitions do NOT yet prove SFAST or PAIR completed. docs/CANONICAL_OIDS.md corrected to omit unnecessary CLEAR lines in the current target gate.

## 2026-09-26 19:06–19:09 CDT: full canonical stage/index pair VALIDATED

User's real CMS log confirms `CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN` assembled without flagged statements and built GITCIDX MODULE (4.07 CPU/4.23 elapsed). STGIN/IDXIN/FIDXIN DD names were successfully defined to GITFIX STAGE/INDEX/SEEK A after harmless `DMSFLD704I Invalid CLEAR request` messages for no previous definition. `GITCIDX SFAST` printed progress at 256, 512, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536, 1792 and `FAST AUDIT VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808` in 20.85 CPU/20.99 elapsed seconds. `GITCIDX PAIR` repeated the complete sequential canonical SHA and seek-cookie audit and printed `PAIR VERIFIED UNIQUE 1808` in 21.24/21.38 s. First canonical SGET `00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C` returned OBJ 1 TYPE 1 SIZE 270 in 0.15/0.15 s; last SGET `EB37E3F23FF4FC137D715D71A711D3B7632D75F2` returned OBJ 1808 TYPE 2 SIZE 5224 in 1.76/1.81 s. Terminal output truncates the PREFIX, but both commands returned RC0. These real target runs establish correct canonical Git OID independent readback, full IDX2 and SIDX2 agreement, saved ftell-cookie matching and complete object SHA verification across all 1,808 objects on the unchanged stage, not crash/reboot recovery proof. Previously verified raw PACK SHA, all 1117 OFS_DELTA applications, STAGE, VERIFY, IDX2 BUILD/CHECK/AUDIT and SIDX2 SBUILD/SCHECK apply to the same GITFIX generation. Historical GITSTAGE/GITINDEX/GITSEEK are legacy noncanonical and must remain separate.

The original SVAUDIT was slow due to reopening every target. Current SFAST and PAIR on CMS use one sequential stage stream each and completed in ~21 seconds. The independent optional latest SVAUDIT one-stream optimization is only host-verified and no longer necessary. The current issue #2 stays open for external and forward REF_DELTA, committed-generation/restart/recovery, and use by higher-level Git client. Mandatory max-work-per-turn rule: keep developing independent repository tasks until actual CMS gate.

## 2026-09-26 19:09 onward: canonical IDX2/SIDX2 target gate PASSED

User supplied full target result: CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN built successfully (4.07/4.23 sec CPU/elapsed). The three GITFIX input FILEDEFs succeeded; invalid CLEAR requests simply indicated no earlier definitions to remove. `GITCIDX SFAST` completed every checkpoint and `FAST AUDIT VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808` (20.85/20.99 s). `GITCIDX PAIR` repeated SFAST, compared all 1,808 canonical IDX2/SIDX2 descriptors and printed `PAIR VERIFIED UNIQUE 1808` (21.24/21.38 s). Direct SGET returned corrected first commit 00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C, OBJ 1 TYPE 1 SIZE 270 (0.15/0.15 s), and last tree EB37E3F23FF4FC137D715D71A711D3B7632D75F2 OBJ 1808 TYPE 2 SIZE 5224 (1.76/1.81 s). Both target GITFIX canonical stage and IDX2/SIDX2 indexes therefore fully reconciled across separate invocation/seek and SHA-1 rehash of all objects. This proves contents in the existing CMS generation, not atomic commit/reboot recovery. Historical IDX1/SIDX1 files remain noncanonical and separate. No more target validation needed for the original 1,808-object stage/index full audit.

Independent next code after this milestone: isolated GITCWALK XPACK/XAPPLY modes resolve an external REF_DELTA base from a separately FILEDEF'd CMS staged-object stream dd:EXTIN. It scans up to 1,808 bounded stage records, validates hex record grammar and rehashes the selected external object using canonical Git SHA before application, failing closed on absent or corrupt bases. Normal RPACK/RAPPLY/STAGE and existing GITFIX artifacts remain untouched. New deterministic generator creates positive XPACK.PACK + EXTBASE.DATA and missing/corrupt negative fixtures. Native host zlib adapter tests external resolution both in XPACK and XAPPLY plus absent/corrupt/unmatched base cases against Git hash-object. Latest CI success: https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36281897291 . THIS NEW FEATURE IS HOST-PROVEN ONLY, NOT RUN ON CMS. User's previous RPACK backward REF and the canonical GITFIX stage/index remain target-proven; issue #2 still open for new external/forward REF gate and durable generations. Mandatory max-work-per-turn rule remains in force.

## 2026-09-26 final target-proven IDX2/SIDX2 gate; host follow-on

Actual latest user CMS result: `CMSCLNK GITCIDX PLAIN` built
without assembler errors (4.07/4.23 s CPU/elapsed). STGIN,
IDXIN and FIDXIN were bound to GITFIX STAGE/INDEX/SEEK A.
An invalid CLEAR request on previously undefined names was
harmless; the three DISK definitions all succeeded.
`GITCIDX SFAST` completed full canonical SHA and ftell-cookie
validation: 1,808 unique entries, 20.85/20.99 s.
`GITCIDX PAIR` cross-checked all IDX2/SIDX2 descriptors
and repeated the full body audit: 1,808 unique, 21.24/21.38 s.
`SGET` independently retrieved correct canonical first commit
`00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C`
(OBJ1, TYPE1, 270 bytes, 0.15/0.15 s) and last tree
`EB37E3F23FF4FC137D715D71A711D3B7632D75F2`
(OBJ1808, TYPE2, 5,224 bytes, 1.76/1.81 s).
GITFIX canonical stage + both indexes are therefore fully
target-proven for this unmodified generation, including complete
readback, reciprocal descriptor agreement, and seek-cookie validation.
Do NOT repeat existing full PACK download, STAGE, BUILD or SBUILD.
Keep historical noncanonical GITSTAGE/IDX1/SIDX1 separate.

Following mandatory maximum autonomous work, GitHub gained:
(1) isolated GITCWALK XPACK/XAPPLY modes which scan FILEDEF EXTIN
CMS stage records (up to 1,808 bounded objects), locate an
external REF base by 20-byte canonical OID, strictly validate
hex grammar and independently recompute its canonical Git
SHA-1 before applying the delta. Short, duplicate, missing,
altered and mismatched bases are rejected;
(2) isolated GITCWALK FPACK which buffers unresolved forward
same-PACK REF deltas and resolves chained dependencies in
bounded passes after all objects have been inflated;
(3) separate GITCIDX GENWRITE/GENCHECK which runs full IDX2/SIDX2
PAIR and writes a versioned GEN2 manifest LAST, binding sorted
OID + ordinal + type + length + ftell cookies in a deterministic
canonical SHA digest. On later GENCHECK, a fresh read of GENIN
rejects malformed/truncated/extra records, reruns full PAIR,
and confirms every descriptor plus digest matches.
GEN2 is a candidate completion proof, NOT atomic promotion or
active-generation pointer. Reboot/logoff recovery not yet tested.

Host CI independently proved forward PACK through actual Git
index-pack and Git cat-file, external REF with one and multiple
stage records, full canonical SHA checks, tamper/duplicate/missing
negative gates, and the GEN2 synthetic 1,808-entry seal/reopen,
manifest corruption/truncation and stage/index tamper rejection.
LATEST GREEN:
https://github.com/mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox/actions/runs/36282493293 .
No new features above are yet target-validated on CMS.
Docs: docs/REF_RESOLUTION.md and docs/GENERATION_RECOVERY.md.
They provide exact Mac single-existing-c3270 uploader commands and
isolated CMS FILEDEF tests. Fixtures include XREAL.PACK, a thin
no-op copy of the known canonical first commit in GITFIX STAGE A
to prove lookup from the actual 1,808-object persisted store.

Remaining issue #2: target validation of new modes, thin PACK
external actual stage, cross-logon/reboot GEN2 verification,
atomic active-generation pointer and multi-file recovery, broader
OFS-on-unresolved-forward dependency support and production Git
client object-store integration. New source/fixtures must be
uploaded before the new CMS test; do not confuse host CI success
with CMS proof or modify existing GITFIX files.
Mandatory rule: keep autonomous work maximal; stop only when
real CMS target validation is required, with exact commands.

## 2026-09-26 19:36–19:40 CDT: FORWARD/EXTERNAL REF AND GEN2 PASSED ON CMS

User supplied real target logs. CMSCLNK GITCWALK NAPI compiled cleanly

OID 00D8D63229305230C8D37F884CE87F9E1A89468C; 8.05/8.17 s
(full stage scan). In this user log, standalone XAPPLY and EXTMULT and
four negative fixture tests were NOT included: do not label those
individual cases CMS-proven; host suite covers them.

GITCIDX GENWRITE against existing, unchanged 1,808-object GITFIX
STAGE A, INDEX A (IDX2) and SEEK A (SIDX2): full SFAST verified all
1,808 unique OIDs and cookies; PAIR verified both indexes, then
GENERATION SEALED 1808 UNIQUE 1808, total 21.41/21.56 s.
GENCHECK reopened the manifest through GENIN GITFIX GEN A and
repeated complete SFAST/PAIR audit with 1,808 unique objects,
then GENERATION VERIFIED 1808 UNIQUE 1808, 21.42/21.57 s.
This proves a sealed, self-consistent candidate-generation manifest
reopened in a separate program invocation in one CMS session, NOT
across logoff/reboot and NOT atomic active-generation promotion.
**Preserve existing GITFIX STAGE/INDEX/SEEK/GEN A and historical
legacy noncanonical GITSTAGE DATA/GITINDEX DATA/GITSEEK INDEX A.**
No more PACK capture or index rebuild. Issue #2 remains open for
cross-logon/reboot proof, atomic active-pointer/recovery, combined
forward OFS-on-unresolved-REF and higher-level native Git integration.

Next useful autonomous performance work: XREAL required 8.17 s to
scan all external staged records to independently reject duplicate
OIDs. Existing target-proven SIDX2 cookies enable a separately scoped
optional direct-seek external REF mode with cryptographic body
verification, leaving XPACK's conservative full scan intact.
Mandatory user max-autonomy rule: implement and host-test as much
as possible; stop only at actual CMS validation with exact commands.
