# CMS/zVM Native Git Client — Chat State

Updated: 2026-09-17
Repository: `mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox`, branch `main`

## Workflow/rules
- GitHub canonical; edit there first, then user pulls/transfers/tests on CMS.
- Whenever files must be transferred to CMS for testing, always provide the Mac
  commands needed to fetch/prepare/transfer them, followed by the CMS commands.
  Do not give only the CMS-side test command. Keep both command batches exact and
  small.
- Proven Mac workflow: user works from the local repository `src` directory and
  runs `git pull`, then `./cms-upload.sh FILE1.EXEC FILE2.EXEC ...`. The upload
  script maps each local `.EXEC` file to `NAME EXEC A` on CMS and performs the
  established DFT transfer. Use this exact workflow in future instructions; do
  not substitute raw c3270/nc transfer commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Exact small CMS command batches. IBM docs first for CMS/zVM; official Git/RFC
  docs for formats. No guessed CMS commands or purchased dependencies.
- No BFS/OpenExtensions runtime dependency. Fixed-80 source <=80 columns.
- CMS file names and file types must each be no longer than 8 characters. Enforce
  this before creating or transferring any CMS-target file.
- c3270 DFT 2048 proven. Preserve target-proven cores; isolate milestones.

## Architecture/environment
z/VM 6.3 Evaluation under Hercules Aethra on Raspberry Pi 5/Debian. Assembler XF
+ DMSGPI available. REXX orchestrates; assembler for binary/native/performance.
Goal: genuine Git interoperability, eventually smart HTTP with native TLS.

## M8 complete PACK summary
M8A ordinary complete pack passed including trailer SHA and negative tests.
M8B OFS_DELTA reconstructs abc -> abcd and verifies trailer. M8C REF_DELTA
resolves real base OID, reconstructs abc -> abcd and verifies trailer. M8
regressions all passed after integration.

## M9 scalability

### M9A chunk semantics — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`GITPBUF` logical byte offsets work across 64-byte CMS records. 80-byte test made
two chunks; boundary and overrun tests passed.

### M9B incremental/selective pack buffer — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
Current `src/GITPBUF.EXEC` blob `47cd29329aed29fa0c99580835a007acf30aee4d`.
M9B adds metadata file `GITPMETA PACK A`, INIT/APPEND/FINAL, and selective READ.
APPEND accepts at most 64 bytes per call, carries a partial tail until a full
64-byte physical record can be emitted, and FINAL emits the last partial record.
READ is forbidden before FINAL and computes only the required CMS record range;
it no longer EXECIO-reads the entire pack file. WRITE remains as compatibility
path and now writes finalized metadata too.

Target results after M9B change:
- existing M9PBUF regression passed fully: 80 bytes -> 2 chunks, normal/boundary/
  stack reads correct, overrun rejected RC=8.
- M9PINC incremental regression passed fully.
- INIT succeeded.
- APPEND fragments of 10, 54, then 16 bytes succeeded (non-aligned calls).
- READ before FINAL rejected RC=8: `GITPBUF: pack buffer not finalized`.
- FINAL flushed partial last record.
- offset 60 count 12 -> `0C0D0E0F0001020304050607` across record boundary.
- READSTACK offset 63 count 3 -> `0F0001`.
- final eight bytes -> `08090A0B0C0D0E0F`.
- final `M9 INCREMENTAL PACK BUFFER TESTS PASSED`.

Known harmless first-run diagnostics: DMSERS002E for absent GITPMETA/GITPBUF when
CLEAR/WRITE removes files before creating them.

### M9C bounded PACK SHA-1 — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPSHA.EXEC` verifies a finalized GITPBUF without assembling the complete
pack in one REXX string. It reads the payload in chunks of at most 64 bytes via
GITPBUF READSTACK, feeds the existing target-proven GITSTRM SHA-1 module, then
reads the final 20-byte trailer separately and compares the digest.

`src/M9CSHA.EXEC` stores the known M8A two-object pack through INIT/APPEND/FINAL.
Target result computed and accepted
`5F1C02695D4BC807AE4A5DD622AD1D28E7659429`. A trailer ending in `...9428`
was rejected RC=8 while the computed payload digest remained `...9429`.
Final target message: `M9C BOUNDED PACK SHA-1 TESTS PASSED`.

A direct GITPSHA VERIFY against the prior M9B arbitrary 80-byte test buffer also
correctly rejected its final 20 bytes as a nonmatching trailer, RC=8. This was an
expected pre-regression sanity check, not a failure of M9C.

### M9D bounded inflater primitive — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPINFL.EXEC` provides an isolated GITPBUF reader-driven inflater path for
the stored-DEFLATE form used by the known M8A ordinary object. It does not first
assemble the complete compressed stream or complete PACK into one REXX hex
string. `src/M9DINF.EXEC` builds the known M8A pack incrementally and exercises
the primitive at the first object's zlib offset.

Target result:
- first ordinary object inflated to `DATA 616263` (`abc`).
- inflater reported `ZLIB BYTES 14`.
- next packed object remained at byte offset 27 with header `33`.
- final `M9D BOUNDED INFLATER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9E bounded general inflater — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPDEF.EXEC` extends bounded GITPBUF DEFLATE consumption to stored, fixed,
dynamic, and mixed blocks. `src/GITPINFL.EXEC` uses it behind the bounded zlib
wrapper. `src/M9EINF.EXEC` exercises the existing M7 fixed/dynamic/mixed vectors.
A REXX variable-scope bug in the first dynamic test was fixed by making the
bounded `bits` routine a PROCEDURE exposing only `base bitpos` (commit
`6f86ae8bb3be01c2708493639d5388ea89b7819b`).

Target results:
- fixed Huffman -> `616263`, `ZLIB BYTES 11`.
- dynamic Huffman -> expected M7 dynamic payload, `ZLIB BYTES 44`.
- stored then fixed -> `616263616263`, `ZLIB BYTES 19`.
- final `M9E BOUNDED GENERAL INFLATER TESTS PASSED`.
- M7INFL and M7DYN regressions passed, including expected negative cases.
- M8PACK, M8OFS, and M8REF regressions passed, including expected negatives.
- M9DINF passed again: `616263`, 14 zlib bytes, next header `33` at offset 27.

The existing general `GITINFL` remains target proven and unchanged. M8 still
uses its whole-pack/whole-string path; M9E has not yet been integrated into the
full pack walker. The bounded inflater still accumulates the complete inflated
object in one REXX hex string.

### M9F bounded ordinary PACK walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` parses PACK and ordinary-object headers directly through
bounded GITPBUF logical offsets and invokes GITPINFL at each zlib offset. It
advances by the inflater's reported consumed-byte count. The initial overlength
name `GITPBWALK` was corrected to CMS-safe `GITPBWLK` before target execution.
`src/M9FWALK.EXEC` builds and verifies the known M8A pack incrementally.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `5F1C02695D4BC807AE4A5DD622AD1D28E7659429`.
- entry 1 at offset 12 reconstructed blob `616263`.
- entry 2 at offset 27 reconstructed blob `78797A`.
- PACK data ended at offset 42.
- offset 42 contained the exact 20-byte PACK trailer.
- final `M9F BOUNDED ORDINARY PACK WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9G bounded OFS_DELTA walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` now parses OFS_DELTA base distances by bounded GITPBUF
offsets, resolves an already reconstructed base by PACK position, inflates the
delta representation through GITPINFL, and applies it with target-proven
GITDAPP. The existing M8 walker remains unchanged.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `8CA36BC28C5A2FDDD0EB9762CA36049A32D114B6`.
- base entry at offset 12 reconstructed `616263` (abc).
- OFS_DELTA entry at offset 24 reconstructed `61626364` (abcd).
- PACK data ended at offset 40.
- final `M9G BOUNDED OFS_DELTA WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9H bounded REF_DELTA walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` now reads REF_DELTA 20-byte base object IDs through bounded
GITPBUF offsets, computes/stores OIDs for reconstructed blobs, resolves the base
against already reconstructed objects, inflates the delta representation through
GITPINFL, and applies it with target-proven GITDAPP.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `7C95D709D4D46C612315060323DF0B5671650684`.
- base entry at offset 12 reconstructed `616263` (abc).
- REF_DELTA entry at offset 24 reconstructed `61626364` (abcd).
- PACK data ended at offset 59.
- final `M9H BOUNDED REF_DELTA WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

M9F/M9G/M9H now provide an isolated bounded-input PACK path for ordinary blobs,
OFS_DELTA, and REF_DELTA. The existing M8 whole-pack walker remains unchanged.

### M9I bounded reconstructed-object store — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITOBUF.EXEC` provides an isolated CMS-backed reconstructed-object buffer
with incremental appends of at most 64 bytes, 64-byte physical records, partial
tail handling, FINAL, and bounded logical-offset reads. `src/M9IOBUF.EXEC`
proved the primitive before integration into the inflater/walker.

Target result:
- 145 bytes appended across multiple physical records.
- pre-FINAL read correctly rejected RC=8.
- cross-record read at offset 60/count 12 returned 4 AA bytes + 8 BB bytes.
- final 17-byte partial record returned all CC bytes.
- overrun correctly rejected RC=8.
- final `M9I BOUNDED OBJECT STORE TESTS PASSED`.

The target-proven M9F/M9G/M9H walker path remains unchanged. GITPINFL/GITPDEF
still return the complete inflated object as one REXX hex string.

## M9J-M9P completion summary
M9J true bounded streaming DEFLATE/zlib writes incrementally to GITOBUF and
passes fixed, dynamic, mixed, and bad-Adler gates. M9K integrates ordinary PACK
objects with bounded OID calculation. M9L and M9M integrate bounded OFS_DELTA
and REF_DELTA reconstruction. M9N proves 4096-byte bounded delta reconstruction
and a 512-byte streaming object. M9O adds bounded input/output caching; the
4096-byte streaming gate passes with Git blob OID
`9D235ED07CD19811A6CEB342DE82F190E49C9F68`.

M9P consolidates ordinary, OFS_DELTA, and REF_DELTA into `GITP9PWK.EXEC`.
`GIT9CTX.EXEC` provides disk-backed multi-object context keyed by PACK position
and OID. Non-immediate OFS/REF bases were target proven, as was a chained delta
where reconstructed `abcd` became the base for reconstructed `abcde`.
The consolidated install path copies one CMS record at a time and does not use
an arbitrary-size EXECIO * stem for reconstructed object data.

Final target regression sweep on 2026-09-17 passed M9JSTRM, M9JZLIB, M9KWALK,
M9LOFS, M9MREF, M9NSTRES, M9NSTRM, M9O4096, M9PCONS, M9PCTX, and M9PCHAIN.
M9P and the M9 scalability milestone are complete/target proven.

## M10 transport progress

M10A side-band to bounded PACK, M10B arbitrary read boundaries, and M10C
upload-pack response framing are DONE/TARGET PROVEN.

M10D real Git upload-pack bytes is DONE/TARGET PROVEN. G10DFIX.EXEC contains
a response captured from Git 2.47.3 upload-pack for a deterministic repository.
M10DREAL.EXEC feeds the unchanged wire bytes through GIT10UP.

The real fixture exposed an ASCII/EBCDIC bug hidden by synthetic tests. Git
pkt-line length fields are ASCII wire bytes. GIT10UP, GIT10BF, and GIT10PK now
decode the four length bytes numerically. GIT10UP recognizes NAK LF by wire hex
4E414B0A.

The real PACK also exposed the old blob-only ordinary-object limit. GITBOID now
hashes COMMIT, TREE, BLOB, and TAG. GITP9PWK walks ordinary types 1 through 4
and carries resolved type through deltas. GIT9CTX stores object type and scans
its index one record at a time.

M10D target result, 2026-09-17:
PACK SHA1 00C20177E759DC5FFD06EA42D0A1D1E1A9F53E7B
COMMIT position 12 size 148 OID 59D72104FBF18B76536A3A99776C7F7930C27CD8
TREE position 124 size 33 OID 747ABC3C651FC0DD12A37E5B5C47E0D02CD0DC4E
BLOB position 168 size 3 OID F2BA8F84AB5C1BCE84A7B441CB1959CFC7093B7F
PACK version 2, objects 3, data end 180.
Final M10D REAL GIT UPLOAD-PACK FIXTURE TEST PASSED.

## 2026-09-18 boundedness hardening closure

Post-reboot recovery and the remaining pre-M11 boundedness work are now target
proven.

GIT9CTX was redesigned to eliminate per-position CMS filenames and their
five-digit position collision. It now uses G9CDATA DATA A plus G9CIDX DATA A
and G9CMETA DATA A, with bounded sequential record access. Commit:
4faf89e073c94b2b4644c2f62b48934cae07651f. M9PCONS, M9PCTX, M9PCHAIN, and
M10DREAL passed after this redesign.

GIT10BF was redesigned as a bounded pkt-line state machine: only a partial
four-byte header and counters are retained; side-band channel 1 is forwarded
incrementally to GITPBUF, channel 2 is discarded incrementally, and channel 3
fails in a controlled way. Final commit:
4a670109244cf18dc297683475ee22544a698ec1. M10BFRAG, M10CRESP, and M10DREAL
passed on target.

GIT10UP was likewise redesigned to avoid retaining an arbitrary incomplete
pkt-line. The final fix preserves the original ASCII pkt-line header across
fragmented PREPAY processing rather than reconstructing it from remaining
bytes. Commit: 5383f2b10b6a376766b24be36b498ee60097feb8.
M10CRESP and M10DREAL passed on target on 2026-09-18.

The final GITBOID strict-boundedness issue is closed. GITBOID no longer uses
EXECIO * DISKR GITHASH DATA A into a REXX stem. GITSTRM now has a CMS-file
input mode and reads GITHASH DATA A sequentially with FSREAD while retaining
the original program-stack interface for PACK SHA regression use. The z/VM
6.3-compatible extended FSCB definition uses FORM=E, RECFM=V, BUFFER, and
BSIZE, with the assembler continuation marker in column 72. Relevant commits:
395dc3bd128ada29329a6e1e661b393ab1ebd564
f2e1804315eb80e82f992ccb70a2df60b3af9105
b387e6c4c6ad4a41a3d058b180b4f40fde86d8e4

Target gates after the final GITSTRM build:
- M9PCONS passed ordinary, OFS_DELTA, and REF_DELTA with exact prior OIDs.
- M9PCHAIN passed abc -> abcd -> abcde; final OID
  6A8165460570531A1247BD99A73B53A5A6E500D5.
- M10DREAL passed the real Git fixture with exact COMMIT, TREE, and BLOB OIDs
  and PACK SHA1 00C20177E759DC5FFD06EA42D0A1D1E1A9F53E7B.

The known pre-M11 unbounded whole-object REXX stem and context-position
collision blockers are therefore closed. M10E then stress-proved transport
boundedness with a maximum normal pkt-line (ffff, 65535 total bytes): a
channel-2 payload of 65530 bytes was delivered in 31-byte fragments through
GIT10BF without retaining the pkt-line payload. M10ESTRS passed on target on
2026-09-18 in T=7.55/9.05. M10B/C/D continue to prove semantics and real-wire
compatibility.

## Persistence / restart point
GitHub main is canonical. M10D is target proven independently of emulator state.
After a target restart, retransmit required source with cms-upload.sh as needed.

Next target regression sweep:
M9PCONS, M9PCTX, M9PCHAIN, M10AFEED, M10BFRAG, M10CRESP, M10DREAL.

M10A-C synthetic fixtures may expose their old EBCDIC header construction after
the correct ASCII parser change. Fix those fixtures, not the production parser.

Before M11, harden GIT9CTX: its G9C plus five-digit PACK-position filenames can
collide above position 99999. Also replace large incomplete pkt-line buffering
with bounded streaming state before real side-band-64k traffic.

## NEXT ACTION
M10 transport framing and boundedness are closed/target proven. Begin M11
native CMS networking/HTTP. M12 remains native z/VM SSL/GSK TLS.
