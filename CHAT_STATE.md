# CMS/zVM Native Git Client — Chat State

Updated: 2026-09-17
Repository: `mostangrymike/ibm-sandbox`, branch `main`

## Workflow/rules
- GitHub canonical; edit there first, then user pulls/transfers/tests on CMS.
- Whenever files must be transferred to CMS for testing, always provide the Mac
  commands needed to fetch/prepare/transfer them, followed by the CMS commands.
  Do not give only the CMS-side test command. Keep both command batches exact and
  small.
- Proven Mac workflow: user works from the local repository `src` directory and
  runs `git pull`, then `./cms-upload.sh FILE1.EXEC FILE2.EXEC ...`. The upload
  script maps each local `.EXEC` file to `NAME EXEC A` on CMS and performs the
  established DFT transfer. Use this exact workflow in future instructions; do
  not substitute raw c3270/nc transfer commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Exact small CMS command batches. IBM docs first for CMS/zVM; official Git/RFC
  docs for formats. No guessed CMS commands or purchased dependencies.
- No BFS/OpenExtensions runtime dependency. Fixed-80 source <=80 columns.
- CMS file names and file types must each be no longer than 8 characters. Enforce
  this before creating or transferring any CMS-target file.
- c3270 DFT 2048 proven. Preserve target-proven cores; isolate milestones.

## Architecture/environment
z/VM 6.3 Evaluation under Hercules Aethra on Raspberry Pi 5/Debian. Assembler XF
+ DMSGPI available. REXX orchestrates; assembler for binary/native/performance.
Goal: genuine Git interoperability, eventually smart HTTP with native TLS.

## M8 complete PACK summary
M8A ordinary complete pack passed including trailer SHA and negative tests.
M8B OFS_DELTA reconstructs abc -> abcd and verifies trailer. M8C REF_DELTA
resolves real base OID, reconstructs abc -> abcd and verifies trailer. M8
regressions all passed after integration.

## M9 scalability

### M9A chunk semantics — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`GITPBUF` logical byte offsets work across 64-byte CMS records. 80-byte test made
two chunks; boundary and overrun tests passed.

### M9B incremental/selective pack buffer — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
Current `src/GITPBUF.EXEC` blob `47cd29329aed29fa0c99580835a007acf30aee4d`.
M9B adds metadata file `GITPMETA PACK A`, INIT/APPEND/FINAL, and selective READ.
APPEND accepts at most 64 bytes per call, carries a partial tail until a full
64-byte physical record can be emitted, and FINAL emits the last partial record.
READ is forbidden before FINAL and computes only the required CMS record range;
it no longer EXECIO-reads the entire pack file. WRITE remains as compatibility
path and now writes finalized metadata too.

Target results after M9B change:
- existing M9PBUF regression passed fully: 80 bytes -> 2 chunks, normal/boundary/
  stack reads correct, overrun rejected RC=8.
- M9PINC incremental regression passed fully.
- INIT succeeded.
- APPEND fragments of 10, 54, then 16 bytes succeeded (non-aligned calls).
- READ before FINAL rejected RC=8: `GITPBUF: pack buffer not finalized`.
- FINAL flushed partial last record.
- offset 60 count 12 -> `0C0D0E0F0001020304050607` across record boundary.
- READSTACK offset 63 count 3 -> `0F0001`.
- final eight bytes -> `08090A0B0C0D0E0F`.
- final `M9 INCREMENTAL PACK BUFFER TESTS PASSED`.

Known harmless first-run diagnostics: DMSERS002E for absent GITPMETA/GITPBUF when
CLEAR/WRITE removes files before creating them.

### M9C bounded PACK SHA-1 — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPSHA.EXEC` verifies a finalized GITPBUF without assembling the complete
pack in one REXX string. It reads the payload in chunks of at most 64 bytes via
GITPBUF READSTACK, feeds the existing target-proven GITSTRM SHA-1 module, then
reads the final 20-byte trailer separately and compares the digest.

`src/M9CSHA.EXEC` stores the known M8A two-object pack through INIT/APPEND/FINAL.
Target result computed and accepted
`5F1C02695D4BC807AE4A5DD622AD1D28E7659429`. A trailer ending in `...9428`
was rejected RC=8 while the computed payload digest remained `...9429`.
Final target message: `M9C BOUNDED PACK SHA-1 TESTS PASSED`.

A direct GITPSHA VERIFY against the prior M9B arbitrary 80-byte test buffer also
correctly rejected its final 20 bytes as a nonmatching trailer, RC=8. This was an
expected pre-regression sanity check, not a failure of M9C.

### M9D bounded inflater primitive — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPINFL.EXEC` provides an isolated GITPBUF reader-driven inflater path for
the stored-DEFLATE form used by the known M8A ordinary object. It does not first
assemble the complete compressed stream or complete PACK into one REXX hex
string. `src/M9DINF.EXEC` builds the known M8A pack incrementally and exercises
the primitive at the first object's zlib offset.

Target result:
- first ordinary object inflated to `DATA 616263` (`abc`).
- inflater reported `ZLIB BYTES 14`.
- next packed object remained at byte offset 27 with header `33`.
- final `M9D BOUNDED INFLATER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9E bounded general inflater — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPDEF.EXEC` extends bounded GITPBUF DEFLATE consumption to stored, fixed,
dynamic, and mixed blocks. `src/GITPINFL.EXEC` uses it behind the bounded zlib
wrapper. `src/M9EINF.EXEC` exercises the existing M7 fixed/dynamic/mixed vectors.
A REXX variable-scope bug in the first dynamic test was fixed by making the
bounded `bits` routine a PROCEDURE exposing only `base bitpos` (commit
`6f86ae8bb3be01c2708493639d5388ea89b7819b`).

Target results:
- fixed Huffman -> `616263`, `ZLIB BYTES 11`.
- dynamic Huffman -> expected M7 dynamic payload, `ZLIB BYTES 44`.
- stored then fixed -> `616263616263`, `ZLIB BYTES 19`.
- final `M9E BOUNDED GENERAL INFLATER TESTS PASSED`.
- M7INFL and M7DYN regressions passed, including expected negative cases.
- M8PACK, M8OFS, and M8REF regressions passed, including expected negatives.
- M9DINF passed again: `616263`, 14 zlib bytes, next header `33` at offset 27.

The existing general `GITINFL` remains target proven and unchanged. M8 still
uses its whole-pack/whole-string path; M9E has not yet been integrated into the
full pack walker. The bounded inflater still accumulates the complete inflated
object in one REXX hex string.

### M9F bounded ordinary PACK walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` parses PACK and ordinary-object headers directly through
bounded GITPBUF logical offsets and invokes GITPINFL at each zlib offset. It
advances by the inflater's reported consumed-byte count. The initial overlength
name `GITPBWALK` was corrected to CMS-safe `GITPBWLK` before target execution.
`src/M9FWALK.EXEC` builds and verifies the known M8A pack incrementally.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `5F1C02695D4BC807AE4A5DD622AD1D28E7659429`.
- entry 1 at offset 12 reconstructed blob `616263`.
- entry 2 at offset 27 reconstructed blob `78797A`.
- PACK data ended at offset 42.
- offset 42 contained the exact 20-byte PACK trailer.
- final `M9F BOUNDED ORDINARY PACK WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9G bounded OFS_DELTA walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` now parses OFS_DELTA base distances by bounded GITPBUF
offsets, resolves an already reconstructed base by PACK position, inflates the
delta representation through GITPINFL, and applies it with target-proven
GITDAPP. The existing M8 walker remains unchanged.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `8CA36BC28C5A2FDDD0EB9762CA36049A32D114B6`.
- base entry at offset 12 reconstructed `616263` (abc).
- OFS_DELTA entry at offset 24 reconstructed `61626364` (abcd).
- PACK data ended at offset 40.
- final `M9G BOUNDED OFS_DELTA WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

### M9H bounded REF_DELTA walker — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITPBWLK.EXEC` now reads REF_DELTA 20-byte base object IDs through bounded
GITPBUF offsets, computes/stores OIDs for reconstructed blobs, resolves the base
against already reconstructed objects, inflates the delta representation through
GITPINFL, and applies it with target-proven GITDAPP.

Target result:
- bounded PACK SHA-1 accepted `7C95D709D4D46C612315060323DF0B5671650684`.
- base entry at offset 12 reconstructed `616263` (abc).
- REF_DELTA entry at offset 24 reconstructed `61626364` (abcd).
- PACK data ended at offset 59.
- final `M9H BOUNDED REF_DELTA WALKER TESTS PASSED`.

M9F/M9G/M9H now provide an isolated bounded-input PACK path for ordinary blobs,
OFS_DELTA, and REF_DELTA. The existing M8 whole-pack walker remains unchanged.

### M9I bounded reconstructed-object store — DONE/TARGET PROVEN
`src/GITOBUF.EXEC` provides an isolated CMS-backed reconstructed-object buffer
with incremental appends of at most 64 bytes, 64-byte physical records, partial
tail handling, FINAL, and bounded logical-offset reads. `src/M9IOBUF.EXEC`
proved the primitive before integration into the inflater/walker.

Target result:
- 145 bytes appended across multiple physical records.
- pre-FINAL read correctly rejected RC=8.
- cross-record read at offset 60/count 12 returned 4 AA bytes + 8 BB bytes.
- final 17-byte partial record returned all CC bytes.
- overrun correctly rejected RC=8.
- final `M9I BOUNDED OBJECT STORE TESTS PASSED`.

The target-proven M9F/M9G/M9H walker path remains unchanged. GITPINFL/GITPDEF
still return the complete inflated object as one REXX hex string.

## M9J-M9P completion summary
M9J true bounded streaming DEFLATE/zlib writes incrementally to GITOBUF and
passes fixed, dynamic, mixed, and bad-Adler gates. M9K integrates ordinary PACK
objects with bounded OID calculation. M9L and M9M integrate bounded OFS_DELTA
and REF_DELTA reconstruction. M9N proves 4096-byte bounded delta reconstruction
and a 512-byte streaming object. M9O adds bounded input/output caching; the
4096-byte streaming gate passes with Git blob OID
`9D235ED07CD19811A6CEB342DE82F190E49C9F68`.

M9P consolidates ordinary, OFS_DELTA, and REF_DELTA into `GITP9PWK.EXEC`.
`GIT9CTX.EXEC` provides disk-backed multi-object context keyed by PACK position
and OID. Non-immediate OFS/REF bases were target proven, as was a chained delta
where reconstructed `abcd` became the base for reconstructed `abcde`.
The consolidated install path copies one CMS record at a time and does not use
an arbitrary-size EXECIO * stem for reconstructed object data.

Final target regression sweep on 2026-09-17 passed M9JSTRM, M9JZLIB, M9KWALK,
M9LOFS, M9MREF, M9NSTRES, M9NSTRM, M9O4096, M9PCONS, M9PCTX, and M9PCHAIN.
M9P and the M9 scalability milestone are complete/target proven.

## NEXT ACTION
M10: real Git transport feeding PACK data incrementally into the bounded M9 PACK
path. Keep transport isolated from the later native CMS networking/HTTP (M11)
and native z/VM SSL/GSK TLS (M12) milestones. First gate should consume real Git
smart-HTTP protocol/pack framing incrementally without requiring the whole PACK
or response in a REXX variable.
